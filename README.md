# NLA_lk_hydro
Project examining patterns and drivers of lake hydrologic variation across the US

# Background
Data from EPAâ€™s National Lakes Assessment (NLA) will be used to explore the magnitude, specific causes, and impacts of lake level fluctuation and to ultimately develop an indicator of lake hydrology alteration indicator for future NLAs.  Associations between NLA drawdown measurements and water isotope information from the 2007 and 2012 surveys may offer a promising analytical approach to separate water-level decline into that caused by evaporation and that caused by water usage.
